## Optimization and functions in Python
This module of the course covers numerical optimization methods and applies them to problems in Python using the SciPy Package.  We apply these techniques to the estimation of structural models of earnings dynamics via Generalized Method of Moments and estimating a model of returns to education with a likelihood function we define.
